<p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is SHEN Fei. I got my PhD degree in Solid Mechanics at Beihang University, China in January 2016. My research works mainly focused on the fatigue failure of metallic materials and structures. Specifically, I developed a continuum damage mechanics-based model to investigate the fatigue crack initiation behavior of contacted components subjected to small relative motions, in which the fatigue damage, wear and their interaction were considered. The fretting fatigue lifetime and the evolution of the wear scar on the contact surfaces were predicted through numerical implementation of the developed model in a finite element package. The obtained results agreed well with experimental data.</p>    

<p>Now I am a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore from March 2016.</p>
