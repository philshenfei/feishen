<p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is SHEN Fei. I got my PhD degree in Solid Mechanics at Beihang University, China in January 2016. My research works mainly focused on the fretting fatigue failure of metallic materials. Specifically, I developed a continuum damage mechanics model to investigate the fatigue crack initiation behavior of contacted components subjected to small relative motions, in which the fatigue damage, wear and their interaction were considered. The fretting fatigue lifetime and the evolution of the wear scar on the contact surfaces were predicted through numerical simulations and the obtained results were compared with the experimental results.</p>    

<p>Now I am a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore from March 2016. In the past two years, I has worked on an A*STAR project on the selective laser sintering (SLS), a powder-based additive manufacturing technique. I has developed a numerical method to model the sintering process of polymeric materials. The developed model is able to assist in the optimization of the SLS process operating parameters including the laser power, scanning speed and hatching space, chamber temperature and bed temperate, resulted in improved SLS products with high mechanical performance.
