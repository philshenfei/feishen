<p>My name is Fei Shen. I am a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), which I joined in March 2016. I received my PhD degree from Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. Meng Qingchun. My disertation focused on the fretting fatigue problem of metallic materials. In the research, A continuum damage mechanics approach was developed to investigate the initiation behavior of fatigue cracks, which considered the combined influences of the fatigue damage and wear. The numerical simulation was implemented to predict the fretting fatige lifetime as well as the evolution of wear scar.</p>    

<p>Now I am invloved in the project of additive manufacturing (3D printing). The selective laser sintering (SLS) technique  is used to produce the light-weight strucutres with high capacity of energy absorption directly through polymer powders (such as TPU, PA12, etc.) in our group. I mainly work on the simulation of mechanical behavior of these structures under monotonic and cyclic compression.</p>

<p>沈飞，86年生人，北航固体力学专业毕业。父母给我起名时肯定是不知道这名与沈阳的航空单位沈飞重名了，大学期间在机缘巧合之下进入北航航空学院读研究生，我想这应该是和航空有缘吧。博士期间有段时间比较无聊，想随便写写但又找不到称心的博客模板，于是就搭建了这个网站。</p>
