<p>Hello, I am Fei Shen. I got my PhD degree in the speciality of Solid Mechanics in Beihang University, Beijing. My disertation focused on fretting fatigue problem. In the research, the continuum damage mechanics method was developed to investigate the fretting fatigue crack initiation behavior and the wear phenomenon. Besides, I have been doing researches in the fields of computational methods about fatigue life prediction and the application of damage mechanics method in multi-axial fatigue.</p>
