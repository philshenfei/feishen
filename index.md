<p>My name is Fei Shen. I am a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), which I joined in March 2016. I received my PhD degree from Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. Meng Qingchun. My disertation focused on the fretting fatigue problem of metallic materials. In the research, A continuum damage mechanics approach was developed to investigate the initiation behavior of fatigue cracks, which considered the combined influences of the fatigue damage and wear. The numerical simulation was implemented to predict the fretting fatige lifetime as well as the evolution of wear scar.</p>    

<p>Now I am invloved in the project of additive manufacturing (3D printing). The selective laser sintering (SLS) technique  is used to produce the light-weight strucutres with high capacity of energy absorption directly through polymer powders (such as TPU, PA12, etc.) in our group. I mainly work on the simulation of mechanical behavior of these structures under monotonic and cyclic compression.</p>
